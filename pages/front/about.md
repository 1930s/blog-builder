# About

I am a full-stack and DevOps developer who enjoys working with functional programming languages.

In 6 years of developer life, I have a lot of experience in many programming languages: C, C++, C#, Python, Go, PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript then I changed my mind with Haskell, PureScript and Scala

In backend, I currently work with TypeScript and PureScript for Node.js, Scala API frameworks (Akka, Http4s) and have fun with Haskell personal projects. I am also have experience in Microservices architecture design, and serverless

In devops, I have experience in AWS and Google Cloud stacks. Docker, Kubernetes, CI, CD with Jenkin, Pipeline, CloudFormation and NixOps

In frontend, I currently use React.js, Angular and Vue.js with Reactive Programming for work. Although I like [Cycle.js](https://cycle.js.org/) and [Halogen](https://github.com/slamdata/purescript-halogen) more, the community is small, and the learning curve is high. Everyone don't want use them for work. I am also interested in Function Reactive Programming from brilliant idea of [Conal Elliott](http://conal.net/)

Computer Science is very broad. I am still a novice in this world. My current target in near future is continuing to improve soft and hard skills, earn experience and find chance to learn from smart software engineer. That is the simple life of a programming nerd.
